Tic Tac Toe V2

You can still only play vs the computer

In this version the computer tries to win and not just block and place randomaly

Bug fixed: if a user entered an non number char when asked to enter a position to place a piece, an Input MissMatch exeption was thrown
Solution: using chars and ascii instead of numbers
*tried using try and catch but ascii was easier 

Added demo and made instructions clearer and in a seperated method

Created user and computer players in main instead of making them global and initialize on calling init()
		
Every char that is similar to x or o will be exepted
